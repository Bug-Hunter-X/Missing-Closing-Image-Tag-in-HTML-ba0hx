<p>This is a common error in HTML, but it can be difficult to spot if you're not careful:</p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some text&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Image"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>The problem is that the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is missing a closing tag.  Browsers are pretty forgiving, but this can lead to unexpected layout issues, especially if you have more complex HTML and CSS.</p>
